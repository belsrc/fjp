# Functional Javascript Playground

Functional Programming was always a weird "why would you use this" way of coding as I've primarily been OOP. I set out to change my view on that and learn more about it and when to use it.
These are some of the functions I collected/made along the way. They are all ES6 and immutable, the parameter order for most lends itself to currying + composing.


## This is very much a WIP
