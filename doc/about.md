Functional Programming was always a weird "why would you use this" way of coding as I've primarily been OOP. I set out to change my view on that and learn more about it and when to use it.
These are some of the functions I collected/made along the way. They are all ES6/ESM, the parameter order for most lends itself to currying + composing. Still a little iffy on the Hindley-milner signatures so they may be slightly off.

## This is very much a WIP
